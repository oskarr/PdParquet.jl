# PdParquet
Some utility functions for [Parquet.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/Parquet.jl) that parses parquet files generated by Pandas (mainly with the PyArrow engine), taking into account Pandas metadata.

The main improvement is that the current method should parse most numpy-encoded dates correctly.

It should be installable with:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/oskarr/PdParquet.jl", rev="dev")
```

It can then be used as:
```julia
using DataFrames
import PdParquet: read_pandas_dataframe

df = read_pandas_dataframe("file.parquet")
```

For an overview of the Pandas parquet metadata, see the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/2.2/development/developer.html).

I'm probably not going to be actively maintaining this beyond what is necessary for my use-case, and it is likely that the code will reside mostly on the dev branch for a long time.
